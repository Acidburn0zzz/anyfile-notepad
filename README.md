# Anyfile Notepad

## This readme is a first draft and is far from complete.

Anyfile Notepad is a Google Drive compatible app that let's you open any type of files on Google Drive and Dropbox.

This repository hosts the code that powers https://anyfile-notepad.semaan.ca/app and is composed of 3 services:
- First and foremost, the client code which encapsulates the application code
- Second, an API (api.anyfile-notepad.semaan.ca) to serve the data that backs the application (syntaxes, extensions and mime types configuration)
- Third, a simple administrative interface to manage the three resources above (admin.anyfile-notepad.semaan.ca)
