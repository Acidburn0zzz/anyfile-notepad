# How to contribute

Although I don't expect contributions to this repo, feel free to submit any bug patches or simple additions that you wish to see in the app.

If you want to tackle a large feature, I would first suggest you get in touch with me (via the [Google community](http://bit.ly/afn-community)) so that discussions can be done beforehand.

# Getting started

* Get a Github account
* Fork this repo
* Follow the instructions to build the app in the readme and ensure the app build properly
* Write code that works
* Propose a Pull request
* Wait and let me unleash the full power of reviewing
* Fix any issues raised during review
* Pull request gets merged
* We drink to that

# Code styling

This project is a representation of my first years of coding so as one can expect, not all code is clean although several improvements have been made in the last year.

When coding in the app, try to follow the code styling of the file you write in regarding variable name case as I never got my mind around one single casing (trying hard though!)

# Code testing

Code is this app is untested (i know, i know...) so when submitting a patch, it isn't mandatory to provide a unit test, just make sure the patch you write works and it will be tested in the review process.
