# What is Anyfile Notepad

Anyfile Notepad is a text editor that lets you open any type of files on Google Drive. To get started simply open a file using the open with function on Google Drive or use the built-in file explorer in Anyfile Notepad to open a file. You can also create new files from the create menu in Google Drive.

# Usual disclaimers...

Please note that we cannot be responsible of any file corruption (not that i want it to happen) or anything destroying your files. This app will never send a destroy command to any of your files but note that non UTF-8 files can be corrupted when used with this app (don't worry the app will also warn you before doing it)

Please note that this program doesn't directly support non UTF-8 encoded documents (like PDF) but it is still possible to open them BUT they will be saved as UTF-8 so editing these files is highly unrecommended.

# How to open any type of files

Right now we are building the mime types database. If you cannot open a file with Anyfile Notepad directly in Google Drive use the file explorer at the left on the editor window. This mime type will be automatically sent to the 'Supported Mime types' page and will be integrated shortly after.

# Creating files

Simply open the Anyfile Notepad app in your Chrome apps, <a href="/app#new">access it directly</a>, or create a new file through Google Drive. The app will automatically detect the mime type of your file based on the extension you put in the file name (html, js, css, c, cs, ...) so it works correctly with your other apps and Google Drive features.

# Security and privacy

Although the app itself isn't using https, it uses it anytime it as to manipulate your files or personal information. Your files and personnal information are ALWAYS encrypted from Google's servers to your computer

Starting from version 2.0, all the content of your files is accessed directly by your device which means it doesn't go though our server anymore

This app doesn't use a caching system for your files and doesn't store any personnal information about you or your files.
